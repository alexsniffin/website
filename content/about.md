I'm a software engineer that strives to solve challenging problems through innovation and deliver business value by going beyond the status quo! In my personal time, I like to learn about technology I don't normally get to learn on the job. Occasionally, I contribute to open-source projects or write my own software engineering blogs! If you didn't notice by the gopher avatar, [Go](https://go.dev/) is my *go-to* language to work with.
