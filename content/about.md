I'm a software engineer and computer enthusiast. I've been programming for over 15 years and over 4 years professionally. My journey started with my fascination of computers and curiosity for how they worked. I then went on to get two degrees, one in computing and one in business.

Throughout my professional career I strive to go beyond the status quo to build and deliver innovative solutions to challenging problems. In my personal time I like to work on open-source projects, write engineering blogs, and work on personal projects.

Some topics that get me excited: Go, Scala, Rust, Distributed Systems, Clean Code and Clean Architecture!
